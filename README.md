## Description 
Welcome to Gizmo's Kitty Key Adventure! In this little game, you play as our feline friend, Gizmo.
The player can use the WASD keys to move around and the Spacebar to jump.
For this final, I wanted to test a basic platformer-style game, and I am really happy with how it turned out!
This is my first time testing out a platformer game in Pygame, and overall, very satisfied!

For all art used, I made it myself. All spritework of Gizmo, the background, and overall all assets were created by me for this project. This is what the "Sprites" folder in my project is for. For the Terrain file, this just includes the terrain of the environment, as well as the blocks that Gizmo jumps around on.

For the background, this is very simple, but it is in fact just the background. I have never tackled a project like this on Pygame, so I went all out in order to make everything look all neat and organized.

To also make this seem more like a general platformer, I went the extra mile and included audio in the background, as well as including gravity for the player to easily show when they are jumping, as well as a moving background in order to really capture the feeling of movement.

I made Gizmo Kitty Key not only for this class, but to also broaden my skills as a programmer. Because of the progress I made over the past weeks with this, testing and going through different bugs, I am really happy with how this project turned out.

For areas of improvement, I would have liked to refine this and maybe add a way for Gizmo to take damage, as I feel like that would also be more akin to a classic platformer game. However, as this was my first time, it is not too shabby.

This project uses a player, as well as controls for that player. As we never learned how to use art to make a mini-game like this in class. I hope you all enjoy Gizmo's Kitty Key Adventure!
