## Description 
Welcome to Gizmo's Kitty Key Adventure! In this little game, you play as our feline friend, Gizmo. 
Use the WASD keys to move around and the Spacebar to jump.
For this final, I wanted to test a basic platformer style game, and I am really happy with how it turned out!
This is my first time testing out a platformer game in Pygame, and overall, very satisfied! 

For all art used, I made it myself. All spritework of Gizmo, the backround, and overall all assets were created by me for this project. This is what the "Sprites" folder in my project is for. For the Terrian file, this just includes the terrian of the enviroment, as well as the blocks that Gizmo jumps around on. 

For the backround, this is very simple, but it is infact just the backround. I have never tackled a project like this on Pygame, so I went all out in order to make everything look all neat and organized. 

I made Gizmo Kitty Key not only for this class, but to also broden my skills as a programmer, because of the progress I made over the past weeks with this, testing and going through different bugs, I am really happy with how this project turned out. 

This project uses a player, as well as controls for that player. As we never learned how to use art to make a minigame like this in class. I hope you all enjoy Gizmo's Kitty Key Adventure!
