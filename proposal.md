# Title
Gizmo's Kitty Key Adventure!
## Repository
https://github.com/marmarbles/PFDA_Kosnar_Anna_Final.git

## Description
 Gizmo will be navigatng towards a door with a key that he has on his collar, navigating in between monsters as they try to attack him! This is relevent to digital arts as it has a lot of art! I plan to sprite Gizmo and the other characters, UI and models. 

## Features
- Player Controls 
	- Player will be able to use the "WASD" keys to move Gizmo the Kitty left and right. 
- Obsticles 
	- Over the course of the level, Gizmo will encounter obsticles such as lava, and dogs, it is your job as the player to dodge them! You loose health if you are too close for too long. 
- Music and SFX 
	- I want this minigame to have all of the advantages of a real game! Therefore, I plan to implement non-copyrighted music and sfx to make the game even more enjoyable! 

## Challenges
- How to import sprite pngs into pygame.
- How to import music into pygame. 
- How to make sure that there are boundaries in the game, and to be on the lookout for any bugs. 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A level that is fully sprited, has music, and basic UI. Player can control Gizmo and compleate the level. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Level that has one level, sprites may not be animated but shows Gizmo moving and jumping.
